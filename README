Test Driven Coffeescript Development
====================================

This is a minimal example of a class for creating tabs in Coffeescript.

There are some commented out production and test code. The idea is that the missing functionallity should be implemented.

Prerequisites:
* ruby (tip: install with rvm)
* bundler (run: gem install bundler)

Then you shall be able to install all dependencies by running:

$ bundle install

The tests can be run with:

$ bundle exec jasmine-headless-webkit -c

And the cucumber features:

$ bundle exec cucumber

If you want to start the example from the beginning you should check out the branch 'start'.
